# photo_importer
Python utility for copying or moving images and movies from a memory card (or between any two directories).

There are plenty of ways to expand the utility: 
  -Add filetype options for user
  -Add destination folder options (flat/full directory structure, file property based destinations, etc)
  -Add utilities to read properties for different filetypes
